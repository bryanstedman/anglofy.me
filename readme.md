Anglophy.js
======
**Anglophy.js** is a small script to translate websites from American English to British English (or the other way around).  

## Requirements
Anglophy.js requires [jQuery](http://jquery.com)

## Usage
To use anglophy.js, simply include the script after jquery and add the url parameter `?en=uk`
```
example.com?en=uk
```

Similarly, if you'd like to translate in the opposite direction, from British English to American English, simply use the url parameter `?en=us` or, if you are feeling particularly cheeky (hi @imyke), you can use `?en=simplified`
```
example.com?en=us
```

Changes only occur on text elements so your class names and styles are safe.
